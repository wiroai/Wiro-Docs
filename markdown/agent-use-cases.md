# Agent Use Cases

Build products with autonomous AI agents using the Wiro API.

## Two Deployment Patterns

Every product built on Wiro agents follows one of two patterns. Choosing the right one depends on whether your users need to connect their own third-party accounts.

### Pattern 1: Instance Per Customer

Most agents interact with external services — posting to social media, managing ad campaigns, sending emails. These require OAuth tokens or API keys that belong to the end user. Deploy a **separate agent instance** for each of your customers.

**Why:** Each customer connects their own accounts. Credentials are bound to the instance, isolated from other customers.

**How:** Call `POST /UserAgent/Deploy` once per customer, then use the [OAuth flow](/docs/agent-credentials) to connect their accounts.

#### Real-World Examples

| Your Product | Agent Type | Why Per-Customer |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Digital marketing agency dashboard | Social Manager | Each client connects their own Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn |
| Mobile app company | App Review Support | Each app has its own App Store / Google Play credentials |
| E-commerce platform | Google Ads Manager + Meta Ads Manager | Each advertiser connects their own ad accounts |
| Marketing SaaS | Newsletter Manager | Each customer connects their own Brevo/SendGrid/Mailchimp |
| Sales platform | Lead Gen Manager | Each sales team connects their own Apollo/Lemlist |
| Content agency tool | Blog Content Editor | Each client connects their own WordPress site |
| App publisher platform | App Event Manager | Each app has its own Firebase project |
| Customer engagement tool | Social Manager | Each brand manages their own social presence |

### Pattern 2: Session Per User

For conversational agents that don't need per-user credentials. One agent instance serves many users, each identified by a unique `sessionkey` that isolates their conversation history.

**Why:** No third-party accounts to connect. The agent answers questions using its built-in knowledge or pre-configured data sources.

**How:** Deploy one instance via `POST /UserAgent/Deploy`, then send messages with different `sessionkey` values per user.

#### Real-World Examples

| Your Product | Use Case | Why Sessions |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Knowledge base chatbot | Answer questions from documentation | No per-user credentials needed |
| Product recommendation advisor | Suggest products based on conversation | Same catalog for all users |
| Internal company assistant | HR policies, IT help, onboarding | Shared knowledge base |
| Customer support bot | Handle common support questions | No external service connections |

### When to Use Which

| Question | Instance Per Customer | Session Per User |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Does each user connect their own social/ad/email accounts? | Yes | No |
| Do credentials differ between users? | Yes | No |
| Is conversation the primary interaction? | Sometimes | Always |
| Does the agent perform actions on behalf of the user? | Yes | Rarely |
| How many instances do you need? | One per customer | One total (or a few) |

## Building Your Product

### White-Label Chat

Build a fully branded chat experience with no Wiro UI visible to your users.

1. Deploy an agent via `POST /UserAgent/Deploy`
2. Start the agent with `POST /UserAgent/Start`
3. Build your own chat UI
4. Send messages via `POST /UserAgent/Message/Send`
5. Stream responses in real-time via [WebSocket](/docs/websocket) using the `agenttoken`
6. Manage conversation history with `POST /UserAgent/Message/History`

```bash
# Deploy
curl -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/UserAgent/Deploy" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "agentguid": "agent-template-guid",
    "title": "Customer Support Bot"
  }'

# Send a message
curl -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/UserAgent/Message/Send" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "useragentguid": "deployed-useragent-guid",
    "message": "How do I reset my password?",
    "sessionkey": "user-456"
  }'
```

### Webhook-Driven Pipelines

For backend-to-backend integrations where you don't need real-time streaming.

1. Send a message with a `callbackurl`
2. Continue processing other work
3. Receive the agent's response via HTTP POST to your webhook endpoint
4. Chain the result into your next workflow step

See [Agent Webhooks](/docs/agent-webhooks) for payload format and retry policy.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/UserAgent/Message/Send" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "useragentguid": "deployed-useragent-guid",
    "message": "Generate a weekly performance report",
    "sessionkey": "pipeline-run-789",
    "callbackurl": "https://your-server.com/webhooks/report-ready"
  }'
```

### Scheduled Automation

Combine agents with cron jobs for recurring tasks.

```
Cron (every Monday 9am)
  → POST /UserAgent/Message/Send (with callbackurl)
    → Agent processes the task
      → Webhook fires to your server
        → Your server emails the report / posts to Slack / updates dashboard
```

This pattern works well for weekly social media content planning, daily ad performance reviews, monthly newsletter generation, and automated lead enrichment pipelines.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Deploy multiple specialized agents and coordinate them from your backend.

```
Your Backend
  ├── Research Agent → "Find trending topics in AI this week"
  │     ↓ webhook response
  ├── Writing Agent → "Write a blog post about: {research results}"
  │     ↓ webhook response
  └── Publishing Agent → "Publish this post to WordPress and share on social media"
```

Each agent is an independent instance with its own credentials. Your backend passes output from one agent as input to the next.

### Deploying an Agent

```python
import requests

headers = {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# List available agents
agents = requests.post(
    "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/Agent/List",
    headers=headers,
    json={}
)
print(agents.json())

# Deploy an instance
deploy = requests.post(
    "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/UserAgent/Deploy",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "agentguid": "social-manager-agent-guid",
        "title": "Acme Corp Social Media"
    }
)
useragent_guid = deploy.json()["useragents"][0]["guid"]

# Connect Twitter via OAuth
connect = requests.post(
    "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/UserAgentOAuth/XConnect",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "userAgentGuid": useragent_guid,
        "redirectUrl": "https://your-app.com/settings?connected=twitter"
    }
)
authorize_url = connect.json()["authorizeUrl"]
# Redirect your user to authorize_url

# Start the agent
requests.post(
    "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/UserAgent/Start",
    headers=headers,
    json={"guid": useragent_guid}
)

# Send a message
message = requests.post(
    "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/UserAgent/Message/Send",
    headers=headers,
    json={
        "useragentguid": useragent_guid,
        "message": "Create a thread about our new product launch",
        "sessionkey": "campaign-q2"
    }
)
print(message.json())
```
