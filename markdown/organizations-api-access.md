# Team API Access

How workspace context is resolved in API requests, and how access controls protect cross-context operations.

## Context Resolution

Every authenticated API request resolves to a workspace context — either **personal** or a specific **team**. The context is determined **automatically** by the project's assignment:

- If the project belongs to a team → team context is activated
- If the project is personal → personal context is activated

You do not need to send any additional headers. The API key carries the context implicitly.

```bash
# This project is assigned to a team — team context is automatic
curl -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/Run/google/nano-banana" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_TEAM_PROJECT_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Hello"}'
```

```bash
# This project is personal — personal context is automatic
curl -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/Run/google/nano-banana" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Hello"}'
```

Create a project inside a team to get a team API key, or use a personal project for personal context. The same `x-api-key` header works for both — no extra configuration needed.

## What Gets Filtered by Context

When a workspace context is active, all list and query endpoints return only resources belonging to that context:

| Endpoint | Personal context returns | Team context returns |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| `Project/List` | Personal projects only | Team projects only |
| `UserAgent/MyAgents` | Personal agents only | Team agents only |
| `Task/List` | Personal tasks only | Team tasks only |
| `Task/Stat` | Personal task statistics | Team task statistics |
| `Project/UsageSummary` | Personal project usage | Team project usage |
| `Wallet/List` | Personal wallet | Team wallet |
| `Wallet/TransactionList` | Personal transactions | Team transactions |
| `Coupon/UserList` | Personal coupons | Team coupons |

## Agent Context Guards

Wiro enforces strict context isolation for agent operations. When you interact with an agent, your current workspace context must match the agent's workspace:

| Your context | Agent's workspace | Result |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Personal | Personal | Allowed |
| Team A | Team A | Allowed |
| Personal | Team A | **Blocked** |
| Team A | Personal | **Blocked** |
| Team A | Team B | **Blocked** |

### Protected Endpoints

The following agent endpoints enforce context guards:

- `UserAgent/Message/Send` — send a message to an agent
- `UserAgent/Message/History` — view conversation history
- `UserAgent/Message/Sessions` — list conversation sessions
- `UserAgent/Message/Delete` — delete a conversation
- `UserAgent/Deploy` — deploy a new agent (team context must match)
- `UserAgent/CreateExtraCreditCheckout` — purchase extra credits
- `UserAgent/CancelSubscription` — cancel subscription
- `UserAgent/RenewSubscription` — renew subscription
- `UserAgent/UpgradePlan` — upgrade plan

### Error Response

When a context mismatch is detected:

```json
{
  "result": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 0,
      "message": "This agent belongs to a team. Switch to the team context to access it."
    }
  ]
}
```

Or for the reverse case:

```json
{
  "result": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 0,
      "message": "This agent is personal. Switch to your personal context to access it."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Practical Examples

### Running a Model with a Team Project

Create a project inside a team, then use its API key. The team context is resolved automatically:

```bash
# 1. Create a project in team context (from dashboard or API)
# 2. Use the project's API key — billing goes to team wallet
curl -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/Run/stability-ai/sdxl" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_TEAM_PROJECT_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"prompt": "A mountain landscape"}'
```

The task is created with the team's `teamguid`. The cost is deducted from the team wallet. The task appears in the team's usage statistics.

### Listing Team Agents with API Key

Use a team project API key to list agents deployed in the team:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/UserAgent/MyAgents" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_TEAM_PROJECT_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"limit": 10}'
```

This returns only agents with `teamguid` matching the project's team — personal agents are not included.

### Sending a Message to a Team Agent

The API key must belong to the same team as the agent:

```bash
# Works — team project + team agent in the same team
curl -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/UserAgent/Message/Send" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_TEAM_PROJECT_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"useragentguid": "agent-guid-here", "message": "Hello"}'
```

```bash
# Fails — personal project + team agent = context mismatch
curl -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/UserAgent/Message/Send" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_PERSONAL_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"useragentguid": "team-agent-guid-here", "message": "Hello"}'
# Returns: "This agent belongs to a team. Switch to the team context to access it."
```

### Wallet Billing Flow

When a task runs in team context:

1. The project's `teamguid` is resolved from the API key
2. The task is created with `teamguid` set
3. On completion, the billing UUID is set to `teamguid` (not the user's UUID)
4. The wallet transaction is recorded against the team wallet
5. The cost is deducted from the team wallet balance

```
API Key → Project (teamguid) → Task (teamguid) → Wallet Transaction (uuid=teamguid)
```

For personal context, the flow is the same but `teamguid` is `null` and billing uses the user's personal UUID.

## Best Practices

- **Separate projects by environment** — create distinct team projects for development, staging, and production. The team context is resolved automatically from the API key.
- **Check agent context before messaging** — if you build a multi-tenant application, ensure the project and agent belong to the same workspace
- **Transfer resources carefully** — agents can only access projects in the same workspace. Plan your resource layout before transferring
