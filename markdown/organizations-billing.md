# Team Billing & Spending

Manage team wallets, set spend limits, control model access, and track usage across members.

## Team Wallets

Each team has its own wallet, independent of members' personal wallets. When a task runs in a team context, the cost is deducted from the team wallet — never from the individual member's personal wallet.

### Funding a Team Wallet

Team wallets are funded the same way as personal wallets:

- **Deposits** — add credit via the dashboard or API while in the team context
- **Coupons** — redeem coupon codes that are assigned to the team
- **Auto-pay** — configure automatic deposits when the balance drops below a threshold

To fund a team wallet, switch to the team context in the dashboard and navigate to **Wallet**. All deposit and coupon operations target the active workspace.

### Checking the Balance

The team wallet balance is visible on the [Organization page](https://wiro.ai/panel/organization) next to each team, and on the team's wallet page. Use the Wallet API in team context:

#### **POST** /Wallet/List

When called with a team project API key, this returns the team wallet balances instead of your personal wallet.

## Spend Limits

Admins can set spend limits at two levels to control costs:

### Team-Level Spend Limit

A cap on total spending across all team members combined. When the team's total spending reaches this limit, new tasks are rejected.

### Member-Level Spend Limit

A cap on how much an individual member can spend within the team. This is useful for giving different team members different budgets.

| Limit Type | Set by | Applies to | Effect when reached |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Team spend limit | Admin / Owner | Entire team | All tasks rejected for all members |
| Member spend limit | Admin / Owner | Individual member | Tasks rejected for that member only |

Spend limits are configured in the team settings page or via the API:

#### **POST** /Team/Update

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `teamguid` | string | Yes | Team guid |
| `spendlimit` | number | No | Team-level spend limit in USD. Set to `0` or `null` to remove. |

Member-level spend limits are configured per member:

#### **POST** /Team/Member/UpdateRole

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `teamguid` | string | Yes | Team guid |
| `useruuid` | string | Yes | Member UUID |
| `spendlimit` | number | No | Member-level spend limit in USD. Set to `0` or `null` to remove. |

### Budget Alerts

When a team's total spending reaches 80% of the team spend limit, admins receive an email alert. This gives you time to increase the limit or pause operations before tasks start failing.

## Model Access Controls

Team admins can restrict which AI models team members are allowed to run. This is useful for:

- **Cost control** — block expensive models to prevent unexpected charges
- **Compliance** — limit usage to approved models only
- **Focus** — restrict the team to models relevant to their work

### Access Modes

Every team has a `modelaccess` setting that determines how model restrictions work. There are three modes:

| Mode | `modelaccess` value | Behavior |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| **All Models** | `"all"` | No restrictions. Team members can run any model on Wiro. This is the default. |
| **Allowlist** | `"allowlist"` | Only models in `allowedmodelids` can be run. All others are blocked. |
| **Blocklist** | `"blocklist"` | Models in `blockedmodelids` cannot be run. All others are allowed. |

You configure one mode at a time. Setting `modelaccess` to `"allowlist"` ignores any `blockedmodelids`, and vice versa. Setting it back to `"all"` removes all restrictions regardless of the model ID lists.

### Configuring Model Access

#### **POST** /Team/Update

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `teamguid` | string | Yes | Team guid |
| `modelaccess` | string | No | Access mode: `"all"`, `"allowlist"`, or `"blocklist"`. Default: `"all"` |
| `allowedmodelids` | array | No | List of model IDs that are allowed. Used when `modelaccess` is `"allowlist"`. |
| `blockedmodelids` | array | No | List of model IDs that are blocked. Used when `modelaccess` is `"blocklist"`. |

Model IDs are the numeric IDs from the model catalog. You can get them from the [Models](/docs/models) endpoint or the dashboard.

### Examples

**Allowlist — only permit specific models:**

```json
{
  "teamguid": "your-team-guid",
  "modelaccess": "allowlist",
  "allowedmodelids": [598, 412, 305]
}
```

Team members can only run models 598, 412, and 305. All other models are blocked.

**Blocklist — block specific expensive models:**

```json
{
  "teamguid": "your-team-guid",
  "modelaccess": "blocklist",
  "blockedmodelids": [721, 650]
}
```

Team members can run any model except 721 and 650.

**Remove all restrictions:**

```json
{
  "teamguid": "your-team-guid",
  "modelaccess": "all"
}
```

### Where Access Controls Are Enforced

Model access is checked at the `/Run` endpoint — when a team member submits a task using a team project API key. The check compares the requested model's ID against the team's access policy before the task is queued.

Access controls do **not** affect:
- Browsing the model catalog (`/Tool/List`, `/Tool/Detail`)
- Viewing model details and pricing
- Personal projects (only team context is restricted)

### What Happens When a Model Is Blocked

When a team member tries to run a restricted model, the Run endpoint returns an error and the task is not created:

```json
{
  "result": false,
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 0,
      "message": "This model is not allowed in your team. Contact your team admin."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Spending Tracking

### Team Spending Summary

The team spending summary endpoint provides an overview of costs broken down by category:

#### **POST** /Team/SpendingSummary

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `teamguid` | string | Yes | Team guid |

```json
// Response
{
  "result": true,
  "teamTotal": 45.23,
  "playgroundTotal": 32.10,
  "apiTotal": 13.13,
  "memberSpent": {
    "total": 12.50,
    "playground": 8.30,
    "api": 4.20
  },
  "spendLimit": 500.00,
  "memberSpendLimit": 100.00
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `teamTotal` | Total spending by the entire team |
| `playgroundTotal` | Spending from playground (dashboard) usage |
| `apiTotal` | Spending from API key usage (projects) |
| `memberSpent` | Your individual spending within the team |
| `spendLimit` | Team-level spend limit (null if not set) |
| `memberSpendLimit` | Your personal spend limit within the team (null if not set) |

All team members can view the spending summary. This allows members to monitor their own usage relative to their limit.

### Project Usage

The project usage endpoint shows spending broken down by project within the active workspace:

#### **POST** /Project/UsageSummary

When called in a team context, this returns only team projects and their spending from the team wallet. In personal context, it returns only personal projects.

### Task Statistics

The task statistics endpoint provides time-series data for task execution within the active workspace:

#### **POST** /Task/Stat

In team context, this filters tasks by `teamguid` and only shows team projects. In personal context, it filters by your UUID and excludes team tasks.

## Coupons

Coupons can be scoped to a specific team, a specific user, or available to everyone:

| Coupon Scope | Who can redeem | Wallet credited |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Everyone** | Any user | The redeemer's active wallet (personal or team) |
| **Team** | Only members of the specified team | The team wallet |
| **User** | Only the specified user | The user's personal wallet |

When a team-scoped coupon is redeemed, the credit is added to the team wallet and benefits all team members.
